I started this calendar in 2017, when I first brought home my puppy Sid. As naturally happens, I made friends in our local dog park with both the 4-leggeds and the 2-leggeds. Someone commented that we all have so many photos of our dogs on our phones that we could probably make a calendar! So I did!

I've organised a calendar for every year since 2017 (with one hiatus year). I collect the photos from everyone through a web-uploader, organise local sponsors to help cover the printing costs, design the calendar, and then distribute them locally. For the 2024 calendar we managed to raise over ¬£1500 for the Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home, a local charity.

I love doing the calendar, and while it takes a lot of time (and some money), it feels so fulfulling to create something for my community, while also doing good for charity!
