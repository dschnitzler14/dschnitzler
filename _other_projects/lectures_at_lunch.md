I organize Lectures at Lunch—a weekly gathering that brings together women from all backgrounds for a dose of inspiration and learning! Whether you're working from home, taking care of kids, juggling schoolwork, or just craving something new, our free online lecture series is the perfect way to connect, learn, and share ideas.

Every Wednesday at 12pm (GMT), we host a quick 20-minute presentation followed by an open 20-minute discussion. It's all about engaging conversations, real-time interaction, and most importantly, building a welcoming, inclusive, and supportive community.

So grab your lunch, your curiosity, and join us—everyone's welcome in this fun, judgment-free zone!
