# Earrings inspired by powerful women

I run a small online jewellery business where I make earrings inspired by powerful women - historical and contemporary. I have earrings inspired by women in science, for example Lise Meitner or Katherine Johnson, as well as other categories such as women in music, activisim, politics, and many more!

For every pair sold I also make and donate a pair to survivors of sexual violence.

I ship to anywhere in the UK.
