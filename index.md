# Hey there! I'm Danny,

a post-doctoral researcher who loves blending science, coding, and creativity. I finished my PhD at the University of Edinburgh and now, Iâ€™m diving into new research at the Medical School Berlin with [Melanie Stefan](https://melaniestefan.net/){:target="\_blank"}. Iâ€™m all about learning and growing, and sharing my journey along the way.

I grew up in Vienna, Austria, but thanks to my American mum, Iâ€™ve always been fluent in English and German. In 2011, I made the leap to Scotland to study Biomedical Science at Aberdeen University. After graduating with my honours degree and integrated masters (MSci), I moved to Edinburgh to kick off my PhD, focusing on anxiety using a prenatal stress rat model. Through the course of my PhD I surprised myself and everyone around me when I really fell in love with coding.

## Right now, Iâ€™m:

Focussing on my passions:

1. Passionate about making science open and accessible, working on projects aimed at fixing some of the problems in scientific publishing. I am also increasingly concerned about the use of GenAI in academia and am working on looking at that too. ([more on that here](/_research_pillars/03_meta-science))
2. Running Paperstars - a platfrom where researchers can anonymously rate and review paper, like Goodreads, but for science! [Check it out here](https://paperstars.org/){:target="\_blank"}
3. Looking at depression through an evolutionary lens ([read more here](/_research_pillars/02_depression))
4. Involved in a number of educational projects ([check it out here](/_research_pillars/01_education))

When Iâ€™m not deep in research, I love teaching and sharing knowledge. I'm contributing to the design of a course on the scientific process at the Medical School, as well as contributing to teaching and course design, and Iâ€™ve developed a cool interactive Shiny app for students to learn the fundamentals of scientific research ([more details here](/research_projects/01_blinkr)). I also get to co-supervise one of our amazing PhD students!

## But itâ€™s not all science!

I also have a few personal projects that keep me busy:

- [**AURICLE:**](/_other_projects/auricle) My earring business, inspired by powerful women. I also donate earrings to survivors of sexual violence.
- [**Dogs of Harrison Park Calendar:**](/_other_projects/dog_calendar) Since 2017, Iâ€™ve organized a charity calendar supporting the Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home. Iâ€™m expanding this idea to help other communities raise money too.

## When Iâ€™m not working, Iâ€™m probably:

- Out on adventures with my two dogs, Sid and Harry, exploring beautiful Scotland.
- Buried in a good book (mostly fantasyâ€”[hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m reading now](reading_blog)).
- Collecting quirky salt and pepper shakers, because why not?
- Engrossed in a new creative hobby - crochet, lino cutting/ printing, watercolour, embroidery, ... (not that I'm particularly good at any of these things, but that's not the point) or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen!
