As inspired by [this blog](https://miketannenbaum.com/principles/){:target="_blank"}, here is an incomplete list of my principles

# 1. Open and Transparent Work
As I'm currently exploring in my [digital garden](https://dschnitzlervercel.vercel.app/){:target="_blank"}, I belive in open science and transparency in what I am doing. I believe that community makes any idea or project better and I am always here to hear what other have to say!

# 2. Learn more!
Leading nicely from point 1, I believe there is always more to learn and that the process never stops. Whether that's deepening my knowledge on a particular subject or learning something completely new. 

# 3. Lift others up
I believe that only good can come from supporting one-another!
