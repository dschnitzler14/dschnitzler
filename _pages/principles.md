As inspired by [Mike Tannenbaum's blog](https://miketannenbaum.com/principles/){:target="\_blank"}, here is an incomplete list of my principles:

# 1. Open and Transparent Work

I believe in openness and transparency in what I am doing. I believe that community makes any idea or project better and I always want to hear what others have to say!

# 2. Learn more!

Leading nicely from point 1, I believe there is always more to learn and that the process never stops. Whether that's deepening my knowledge on a particular subject or learning something completely new.

# 3. Lift others up

I believe that only good can come from supporting one-another!
