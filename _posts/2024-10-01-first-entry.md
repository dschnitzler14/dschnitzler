Will this post be a lonely thing forever doomed to haunt the internet, never being put to rest in an archive? Probably. But I will try to populate this stuff and nonsense as I go along, so it is no longer friendless and alone.

Okay, I thought long and hard about how I want to structure. I am working on a million different projects, some work, some not, but all of them me and all of them contributing to my _learning journey_. As such, I decided to keep everything in the same place.

I intend to post semi-regularly with updates and miscalleny, sometimes we just need a place to put the cool things we find on the internet!
