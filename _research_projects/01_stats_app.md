- **Background**: Our wonderful colleague CJ has created an incredibly useful and well-thoughout [statistical textbook](https://biomedical-sciences.ed.ac.uk/experimental-design-and-data-analysis/what-to-do-with-experiments), in video format. Free and totally accessible! I myself learned a lot from this textbook and had the idea to create an interactive app to go along with it.
- **Aim**: Create an interactive Shiny app as a companion to Crispin's textbook
- **Progress**: Pilot example done, now need to organise the next steps

## Updates

**October 2024**:
I spent a day learning how to write a Shiny app (I already know R, so it wasn't a huge leap) and created a pilot example of one chapter sub-heading. Let me tell you - it was very fun. I also wanted to come at this blind, to see how difficult it would be learn how to use Shiny (not difficult). I am very pleased with the outcome and intend to expand to the rest of the textbook. In fact, we have been mulling over the idea of making this a hackathon event, for others to join in (hence why I wanted to see how easy/ difficult it is to learn how to use Shiny!).

Now the next step is to conver what I have to modular app, because it is quite big and bloated, and that's just one section of one chapter! The next step is to write a guide for the potential hackathon or other contributors, and then, well, organise the hackathon! I've never done anything like that before, so this too will be a learning experience!
