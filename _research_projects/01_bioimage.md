title: Automated BioImage Analysis
description: Improving the workflow of bioimage analysis
tag: ðŸ”§

- **Background**: As yet unstarted, this project is a continuation of work I did during my PhD, where I developed a semi-automated analysis pipeline for images of brain sections processed by _in situ_ hybridisation. I'm hoping to fully automate the process of selecting the relevant brain regions, rather than manually tracing them freehand from a brain atlas.
- **Aim**: Develop a fully automated tool for bioimage analysis
- **Progress**: Not yet started.
