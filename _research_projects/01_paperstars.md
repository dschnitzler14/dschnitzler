- **Background**: This project is still nascent. I had the idea that one way to help science as field to improve would be by creating something like a "Goodreads" for scientic papers. A combination between a virtual journal club, science communication, and review website, Paperstars would allow scientists to discuss and rate scientific papers. One of my life goals is for citations in the future to look like this: Smith et al., 2024$^{5}$, where the superscript **5** is the weighted rating. Right now, a citation simply means that that paper exisits, not that it is neccessarily good. This way, ratings would clarify the quality of the research being cited. I think it would also prompt researchers to try and produce better papers, not just try an appease journal reviewers.

  In addition, I would like there to be a space for papers to be "translated" for everyone to understand. This can be a fun and creative process, as the output of a paper does not need to be another block of text. I mean it can be, but it can also be podcast, a video, a diagram, a shiny app, etc... This is particularly fun, because it will not just focus on the "big important" papers, but also the smaller ones not covered by the press. I'm hoping it can make science more accessible and transparent to everyone.

- **Aim**: Create a website for this to take place!
- **Progress**: Learning how to create a website using a Django framework, as 1. it's fun, 2. I get to learn something new, and 3. I think this is the best approach.

## Updates

**October 2024**:
I am still working my way through tutorial hell. This is a **big thing** to learn. I'd like to have a functional website by December this year, so I can polish it and have a poster at a meta science conference in April.
