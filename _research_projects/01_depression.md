- **Background**: This one is a biggie. I'm interested in looking at depression from the perspective of evolutionary (mal)adaptation of energy conservation. Somewhat parallel to the research I did during my PhD, where I looked at anxiety as a (mal)adaptation to prenatal stress (i.e. being prepared for a harsh external environment vs being overly sensitive to the external environment) I thought a lot about what depression is "good for". In other words, anxiety has a pretty clear survival purpose - fight or flight, but this time it's not a lion or a bear, it's an email or Monday morning. It occurred to me that one of the main features of depression is extreme fatigue, so I wondered if anyone had done any research into the energy conservation as a maladaption, presenting as depression. One someone had ([John Tsiouris](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?sort=date&term=Tsiouris+JA&cauthor_id=16061329)), but he published 3 papers on this and then retired, as far as I can tell. Feeling validated that I am not entirely delusional, I decided to try to approach this myself. In terms of project aims this is difficult to summarise - this is an entire field of research, not just one project. As such, I will only list the first project of this enormous endeveour.
- **Aim**: Compare relevant sequenced genomes to determine if there is any overlap between hibernation and depression.
- **Progress**: Collecting the relevant literature with the relevant data. Also working on a literature review/ hypothesis paper.

## Updates

**October 2024**: This is a relatively slow moving project, largely because I keep getting distracted by interesting papers and rabbit holes to go down. Need to stay focussed.
